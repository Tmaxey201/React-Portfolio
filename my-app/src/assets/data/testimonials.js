      'Thomas was a student of mine at the UNC Coding Bootcamp. He is a wonderful person to work with and teach. He has shown a genuine interest in coding and becoming the best developer he can be. He works well with other students during projects and is always exploring new technologies and how to implement them. I would highly recommend Thomas to anyone in need of a developer.',

      'I was a TA for the Web Development Certificate Program at UNC Chapel Hill when Thomas was taking the course. From day one Thomas approached the course with a positive attitude, even when we were covering very difficult topics. This positive attitude allowed him to quickly gain an understanding of everything we covered in the course. For example he was able to go from knowing nothing about React to being great at it incredibly quickly. But the thing that impressed me the most about Thomas was he always asked the right questions in order to make himself a better developer and never settled for being "good enough" at something. Thomas has became a more-than-competent developer at this point and he has the ability to pick up new skills quickly. Because of this I can say with certainty that Thomas would be a huge asset to any organization. ',

      'Thomas approaches projects with a can-do attitude. He doesnt get overwhelmed easily and will ask the questions that need to be asked. He has an unique eye for design, making the projects come alive to the users. He was great in group settings, worked on finding solutions that worked for everyone as whole, didnt get frustrated when running into technical issues, and honestly made working on projects more enjoyable over all. I would definitely recommend working with Thomas and hopefully we can do it again in the future! ',

      'I had the pleasure of working with Thomas throughout our time at UNC-Chapel Hill’s boot camp. He has always been very dedicated to learning how to code and searching for new technologies to learn alongside the intense curriculum. Thomas is an ace at UX/UI design, always getting into the mind of the user and how they will experience the website. He took charge of our first major project together and blew me away with the design of our site, Global Gastronomy. I look forward to collaborating with Thomas in the future! ',
